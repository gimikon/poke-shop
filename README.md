### Technology 
React, bootstraps


### The lesson I learned
In my opinion, React is all about props and state.
In this project, instead of my old way of passing props(data) between parent and child components, I used Context API and this was Game changer for me. You can only refer to one place to pull data such as pokemon image, name and so on. It gave me a lot of nightmares as I was not used to use this context API. However, once you get a hang of it, it came quite easy to understand and I learned so much how to pass props with it.

### Wanted feature
I would like to implement a way that users can stay on the same page where they are looking at each item since they are redirected to top of the page when they go see each pokemon description.

Also, this project was all based on Front end, it would be nice to have Back end and where purchase history can be saved in database so that users can go look at what they have bought in the pase.
